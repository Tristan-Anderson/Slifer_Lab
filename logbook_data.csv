1/29/2019 3:07 PM	David Ruth	All the junk cleared out from the test logbook, barring the few extra features discussed during the meeting today, this virtual logbook should be open for actual logbook posts as of now.
1/30/2019 2:15 PM	David Ruth	Ionivac is still on the shells, as they slowly leak from what was once turbo vacuum
2/5/2019 6:09 PM	Elena Long	"Bad news: The VNA, even when not sweeping, introduces noise on the VME at it's \""park frequency\"" (aka whatever frequency is the beginning of the VNA sweep)"
2/5/2019 6:12 PM	Elena Long	"Other good news: The VNA, once installed, doesn't stop the DAQ from sending sound to the speakers. This might be an issue if we ever need to completely reset the VNA, but the problem is solved by just turning the Windows sound option back to \""Speakers\"", which both lets you hear sound and lets the VNA work"
2/5/2019 6:13 PM	Elena Long	Other bad news: Can't get A GPS signal in 103 to try to use the VNA's external oscillator to try and fix the problem

3/11/2019 5:06 PM	David Ruth	Leak detector is working, used black roughing pump in parallel to leak check fridge. Only spots with substantial leaks are both quick connects on top plate of fridge. The 1 inch quick connect that had the level probe in it is the biggest leak, and the 2 inch quick connector is a slightly smaller leak (with ordinary Viton O-Ring and metal blank)

3/12/2019 6:52 PM	David Ruth	Pump/purge and initial fill of nitrogen seems to have ruined connection on M4 and M5. Unclear if they will come back as both resistors are now reading infinity.
3/12/2019 7:00 PM	Elena Long	Where are M4 &amp; M5?
3/12/2019 6:59 PM	David Ruth	The bottom and second to bottom of the magnet , basically the two that are on the coils themselves
3/12/2019 7:01 PM	Elena Long	Thank you
3/12/2019 7:09 PM	Lab	New helium cylinder is mysteriously out already. Nathaly and I find it hard to believe we used the whole thing of helium in the last day but that seems to be the way it is. We still have the cylinder intended for Karsten so hopefully we have enough for backfilling, pump/purge, etc, but a lot of helium seems to have gone to waste
3/12/2019 7:12 PM	Elena Long	The one on the left or the right?
3/12/2019 7:11 PM	David Ruth	Both of them. Nathaly says she swapped them yesterday, as the one on the right was previously new
3/12/2019 7:11 PM	David Ruth	Unless someone else somehow did a double swap back to the old one without realizing it
3/12/2019 7:13 PM	karl slifer	What?!
3/12/2019 7:14 PM	karl slifer	I mean, wow. 
3/12/2019 7:14 PM	Elena Long	I know the one on the left was at 1200 or 1300 before leak checking the target stick
3/12/2019 7:14 PM	Nathaly Santiesteban	Can we order a new one for the target changes?
3/12/2019 7:15 PM	Tristan Anderson	Isn't there another cylinder lassoed to the back worktable next to the grey cabinet?
3/12/2019 7:16 PM	Elena Long	Everyone keep an eye and note the main pressures of them every time they're used. If you don't the main needle visually dropping, STOP whatever you're doing and fix the leak before continuing
3/12/2019 7:16 PM	Nathaly Santiesteban	My bad  Not panic 
3/12/2019 7:15 PM	David Ruth	M4 just came back online
3/12/2019 7:17 PM	Nathaly Santiesteban	We still have some, we do have some. I just not check properly. We have 1600 of the new one. The right to that one is empty though.
3/12/2019 7:17 PM	karl slifer	Not till thursday. But are you really saying we used 2 1\/2 cylinders in the last week?  If so there is something very wrong, like they were just left flowing to atmos. 
3/12/2019 7:18 PM	Elena Long	Can we make a paper log to keep by the tanks?
3/12/2019 7:18 PM	karl slifer	There is a spreadsheet page where people should be logging them
3/12/2019 7:19 PM	David Ruth	We can but I think it was a miscommunication between me and Nathaly. We definitely did not use 2 1\/2 cylinders in the last week. The one on the right was used for several weeks and just ran out recently. Nathaly says the new one was at 1900 when it arrived and is now at 1600.
3/12/2019 7:20 PM	David Ruth	So we've used 3\/19ths of the new cylinder on pump\/purge type tests today. We thought it was empty because I closed the silver valve as well as the one on the regulator and Nathaly didn't know, so she thought it was empty
3/12/2019 7:21 PM	Nathaly Santiesteban	"When I arrived Monday morning the \""old\"" tank was empty, so I changed it."

3/12/2019 8:09 PM	David Ruth	Precool is complete, calibration for Magnet ABs seems to be off as all read ~85K
3/12/2019 9:08 PM	karl slifer	Seems weird. I don\u2019t remember Ln2 cools leveling at 85k. Did the magnet calibrations maybe get modified since last fall?
3/12/2019 9:15 PM	David Ruth	I don't think so. I will check the data in the morning to see where precool leveled off. 
3/12/2019 9:42 PM	Nathaly Santiesteban	<http:\/\/nuclear.unh.edu\/wiki\/images\/b\/b3\/04-10-2018_magnet_precool_magnetT.png>  ---  attached=[image.png]
3/12/2019 9:43 PM	Nathaly Santiesteban	This plot from the precool of april 2018 shows temperatures higher than 80 K when we filled with LN2.
3/12/2019 9:44 PM	David Ruth	Oh, okay! Seems like it might be par for the course then
3/12/2019 9:46 PM	karl slifer	Well, prob fine but doesnt it look like  M2 went to about 77K?  
3/12/2019 9:51 PM	Nathaly Santiesteban	I got the data file, when it was cooled: M1=81.5K, M2=80.2K, M3=84.2K, M4=81.7K, M5=73.6 K
3/12/2019 9:53 PM	Nathaly Santiesteban	And I think I saw a little disagreement between the lakeshore temperatures and the vi temperatures, so that may be it. But for sure, the temperatures reached equilibrium before we stopped the filling.
3/12/2019 9:57 PM	karl slifer	Ok, thanks very much for checking. They\u2019re reading a little higher, but if they really leveled off its fine for now. 
3/12/2019 10:02 PM	Nathaly Santiesteban	No problem!
3/13/2019 9:28 AM	Elena Long	Hard part of target stick soldering is done. I changed plans slightly to make both stronger connections on the small pins and added extra reinforcement to protect them.

3/13/2019 9:29 AM	Elena Long	Putting it on the semirigid cables now
3/13/2019 9:38 AM	David Ruth	Awesome!!
3/13/2019 9:50 AM	David Ruth	Calibrations were changed between April and Nov 2018, improving match to LHe but slightly decreasing match to LN2. Current results for magnet Allen Bradleys match the results for the Nov 2018 precool.
3/13/2019 10:15 AM	David Ruth	Currently blowing out LN2 to begin the pump and purge
3/13/2019 10:24 AM	karl slifer	If the fit can\u2019t simultaneously pass thru the two lowest data points (4k&amp;77k) I think this  means that the fit puts too much weight on the room temperature and icewater calibration points. <@U789FH456> after the cooldown (and you are feeling better, this is just a reminder so I don\u2019t forget to ask you) can you please refit using just a single data point near RT? Or modify the error bars on the calibration points to de-emphasize the high temp points.

3/13/2019 11:50 PM	David Ruth	Fridge overfilled to approximate top of separator
3/14/2019 8:44 AM	Elena Long	Looking at the hourly reports, the overfill in the fridge didn't last long at all. On an hour and a half, there was only LHe left in the nose, at 2.5 hours just a little bit at the bottom of the nose, and by 3.5 hours it was gone. 8.3 hours later and it's almost back to where we started before the overfill. 
3/14/2019 8:46 AM	David Ruth	But the magnet is still overfilled, so once we get in we should be able to get it back before we do a fill hopefully
3/14/2019 8:50 AM	Elena Long	Without the stick it took ~4 hours until there was no more helium in the nose
3/14/2019 8:52 AM	Elena Long	Did CX.T2 die on us? I don't see it on the stream
3/14/2019 8:53 AM	Nathaly Santiesteban	We have leaks, that can easily do it.
3/14/2019 8:53 AM	David Ruth	No, it isn't in the main data stream right now, just the hidden resistance one
3/14/2019 8:54 AM	David Ruth	Also unknown how well the calibration from T1 holds up for it
3/14/2019 8:55 AM	David Ruth	I think the quicker cooling sounds like a combination of leaks in top plate of target stick, and helium volume o\nIn fridge being less due to volume of stick onsode
3/14/2019 8:55 AM	David Ruth	I mean, quicker warming

3/15/2019 1:14 AM	Elena Long	Polarization starting to make big jumps with each movement of 0.0001 GHz, I think I'm getting close
3/15/2019 1:40 AM	Elena Long	Optimum positive polarization should occur at nu_e + nu_p = 140,140 MHz + 212.88 MHz =~ 140,353 MHz. Divide that by 12 to get what I feed the x12 multiplier/amplifier chain and I get 11,696.01 MHz for my expected saturation. 
3/15/2019 1:41 AM	Elena Long	Currently at 11,684 MHz and still going up
3/15/2019 1:42 AM	Elena Long	OOP I've finally found the far end! 11685 MHz x 12 was too far and started to drop
3/15/2019 1:44 AM	Elena Long	Down to 11,683 and it's started to climb again
3/15/2019 2:02 AM	Elena Long	OMG I love this! Ok, so, gyromagnetic ratios. gamma_e/2pi = 28,024.9516 MHz/T according to NIST. gamma_p/2pi = 42.57747892 MHz/T. If I take the frequency I feed into the mmwaves that gives the max polarization, which seems to be 11,683.5 MHz. I multiply that by 12, which is what the amplifier/multiplier chain does, giving f_mm = 140.202 GHz. Divide f_mm by (gamma_e+gamma_p)/2pi should give me B. The field I get from that? 4.9952 T. PHYSICS WORKS!!!
3/15/2019 2:04 AM	Elena Long	So if I use the same equation but with (gamma_e - gamma_p) instead of (gamma_e + gamma_p) then I should be able to cause a spin-flip

3/15/2019 4:27 AM	Elena Long	Last tiny bit of flooding the fridge while the magnet finishes ramping down
3/15/2019 4:33 AM	Elena Long	Everything turned off. I left the VNA running if y'all want to have fun trying to see the NMR signal appear while ramping up (this didn't occur to me until now, but I would love to know if it's possible to see it at 1 T. I tried for a couple minutes tonight but didn't see it and am exhausted.) Fridge filled, magnet filled, pumps off, heater off, all pop-off vales checked to make sure they're open, quadruple checked I closed the dry gas and liquid lines. I'll be back...sometime. But at least the power test is done. Good luck tomorrow morning!!

3/15/2019 9:01 AM	karl slifer	Yes, congrats for getting it done during a tough night. Can someone plot p vs power so we can see for sure?  And who\u2019s gonna be in this morning?

3/15/2019 10:27 AM	David Ruth	Calibrated CCS seems to have changed by about 0.15 K during the magnet ramp, while calibrated cernox stayed the same. Possible result of magnetic cooling?
3/15/2019 11:47 AM	Nathaly Santiesteban	Thomas moved the flowmeter to the exit of the main roots. Good Data at 1 K for Chile.
3/15/2019 12:19 PM	karl slifer	We did a TE (4k) this morning and then a quick re measure of the power curve, also at 4k. The power saturation was not as obvious and the max polarization was about 9% at 4k. (Calibration constant was much diff from last night. Nataly will post plots). Then we turned on the fridge and went to about 1 k. Polarization was stillsteadily growing at about 17%. Then unexplained nosedive in the polarization and bunch of things went wrong at once. \n\nWe turned off microwaves and figure out what triggered the polarization loss.   ---  attached=[image_from_ios.jpg]
3/15/2019 12:22 PM	karl slifer	And we seem to have a chord gremlin. Vapor pressure, shells pressure, pirani and separator pump were all unplugged at various points this morning. Please make a log if unplugging critical stuffs.

3/15/2019 2:33 PM	Elena Long	My guess was that my points were off by at least a factor of 6 given the weird TEs I was getting before starting
3/15/2019 2:35 PM	Elena Long	The polarization curve looks a lot like the power curve
3/15/2019 2:37 PM	David Ruth	Not sure if someone already mentioned but the weird TE you took last night was certainly a result of the vapor pressure being unplugged, as that's the temperature the te pol uses in my calculator
3/15/2019 2:38 PM	Elena Long	Ok, so that could be recalculated using the NMR curves and the Cernox to get my actual polarization, yeah?
3/15/2019 2:39 PM	Elena Long	Because even though they were weird, I took multiple and the CC at least seemed to agree well with each other
3/15/2019 2:40 PM	David Ruth	Yeah, absolutely. The TE data is there, we just need to match it to the stick thermistor data instead
3/15/2019 2:42 PM	Elena Long	And we can depolarize really quickly now at least :-)
3/15/2019 2:53 PM	karl slifer	I spoke too soon. Nmr lines 1,2,4 on stick are completely open which explains why no signal yesterday. And I don\u2019t understand what is going on inside the stick. See attached photo. It look nigh impossible to navigate the hdmi and nmr connectors around this bundle of soldered semirigid cable. I assume something weird happened since this was made but maybe this is part of the design?  If so, I don\u2019t see how to make the connections without the semirigid cable destroying the thermom wires in the ladder.   ---  attached=[image_from_ios.jpg]

3/15/2019 2:57 PM	Elena Long	There were some last minute changes because of the NMR connector problems
3/15/2019 2:57 PM	Elena Long	I found it easier yesterday to unscrew the inner part, too, pull out gently, make the electrical connections then put all back in together
3/15/2019 2:58 PM	karl slifer	So <@U7166QLBW> Was the semirigid extended luke that when you mounted the epoxy ladder?

3/15/2019 8:12 PM	Elena Long	There was a spike in temperature when we inserted, which isn't surprising since 90% of the stick was at room temperature. Insertion went nice and easy once the target stick was prepped. The hard part was closing the target cups, because the redesign to add the screws got in the way of the closing clips. Will need to redesign for next time, possibly having the NMR coils on the side opposite where they were this time to make closing the cups under cryogen easier.

3/16/2019 11:04 AM	Nathaly Santiesteban	we can confirm the teflon o-ring between the shells and the fridge broke, and as soon as we pull vacuum on them, it stars to pull air inside the fridge. Therefore, we can\u2019t use the baking pumps or roots anymore until we fix it.
3/16/2019 11:06 AM	Nathaly Santiesteban	The status of the o-ring between the shells is unknown, because we can\u2019t hear or see the leaks. But the vacuum of the shells does not seem to get lower of 2mTorr.

3/16/2019 5:12 PM	Elena Long	The flow rate out of the magnet dewar seems to be directly related to field ramp. Will put into persistant mode when ramped to see if it drops, which I expect it to.
3/16/2019 5:18 PM	Elena Long	Each of those steps is from ramping to a new field. The down-slopes are the fridge refills.  ---  attached=[2019-03-16_1715.png]

3/16/2019 5:37 PM	David Ruth	The te maker is now reading the cernox instead of the vapor pressure

3/16/2019 7:04 PM	Elena Long	I'm just struggling to get a signal on the Q meter
3/16/2019 7:04 PM	Elena Long	Should the diode light be on or off?
3/16/2019 7:10 PM	Elena Long	Also for tomorrow, would anyone be willing to come in to take out the target stick? If someone wouldn't mind helping with target removal tomorrow morning for end-of-cooldown, I can keep running NMR for a few more hours

3/16/2019 7:14 PM	Elena Long	Maybe that would help :slightly_smiling_face:
3/16/2019 7:24 PM	Nathaly Santiesteban	If it is tomorrow during the morning I can go to help with the target stick.
3/16/2019 7:24 PM	Nathaly Santiesteban	Light always on

3/16/2019 7:26 PM	Nathaly Santiesteban	Diode should look like :disappointed:  by using only the phase cable
3/16/2019 7:39 PM	Elena Long	Somewhat unsurprising, possibly (?) bad news: The NMR cables *are* picking up at least a little background from Kel-F. I can see the 19F TE at 5T
3/16/2019 7:40 PM	Elena Long	If the Kel-F got contaminated with hydrogen at any point, then our TEs will be affected. On the bright side, the 19F peak should be huge, but I'm only seeing a tiny bit of it.

3/16/2019 8:07 PM	David Ruth	:upside_down_face: 
3/16/2019 8:07 PM	Nathaly Santiesteban	But still the signal should be visible in the diode. If it is not clear in the mode
3/16/2019 8:08 PM	David Ruth	Shouldn't it only be clear in diode if tune is off
3/16/2019 8:08 PM	Elena Long	The diode signal should be small compared to mod
3/16/2019 8:08 PM	Elena Long	the diode is the full Q, the mod is just the real part which is just the part with the NMR signal
3/16/2019 8:08 PM	Elena Long	so mod gives a much cleaner signal

3/16/2019 9:56 PM	Elena Long	I think it's as big or bigger of a stick than we had yesterday
3/16/2019 9:56 PM	Elena Long	if we were in cup #3 yesterday, then shouldn't it go down some to get to cup #2?
3/16/2019 9:57 PM	David Ruth	It is down, I believe. The printed spacer should be nearby if you want to check
3/16/2019 9:57 PM	Long Lab	UCA = 0.4894 V
3/16/2019 9:57 PM	David Ruth	When I was swapping, pretty sure stick is smaller than apacer
3/16/2019 9:57 PM	David Ruth	Not sure about the microwave spacer however
3/16/2019 9:58 PM	Long Lab	There is no mmwave spacer
3/16/2019 9:58 PM	David Ruth	So is possible waveguide is on wrong xup
3/16/2019 9:58 PM	David Ruth	Oh
3/16/2019 9:58 PM	Long Lab	But I put it in the correct position before starting the power test
3/16/2019 9:58 PM	David Ruth	Okay
3/16/2019 9:58 PM	David Ruth	Not sure then. About 60 percent confident the stick in now is smaller than spacer but we never got to optimize y of stick
3/16/2019 9:59 PM	David Ruth	So it could easily be out of sweetspot a bit.l, or microwaves could be
3/16/2019 9:59 PM	Long Lab	"the stick spacer is labelled 5 1\/8\"""
3/16/2019 9:59 PM	Long Lab	"I thought last night's was 5.5\""?"
3/16/2019 10:00 PM	Long Lab	"So today's should be 4 1\/4\""?"
3/16/2019 10:00 PM	Long Lab	"If they're off by 1.25\"" between cups?"
3/16/2019 10:00 PM	David Ruth	Also relevant is that as far as I know we don't know if tempo works as a but doping agdnt
3/16/2019 10:00 PM	Elena Long	Saturating at 0.59% pol
3/16/2019 10:01 PM	David Ruth	Marking is wrong, nathaly cut a stick that was originally 5 1\/8
3/16/2019 10:01 PM	Long Lab	UCA at 0.2260 V
3/16/2019 10:01 PM	David Ruth	To be 4.25
3/16/2019 10:02 PM	Long Lab	ok
3/16/2019 10:02 PM	Long Lab	I feel better about that
3/16/2019 10:02 PM	Elena Long	Still staturated around 0.59 - 0.6%
3/16/2019 10:03 PM	Long Lab	mmwaves on full power
3/16/2019 10:03 PM	Elena Long	No change in polarization, still 0.59-0.6%
3/16/2019 10:09 PM	Long Lab	Putting in negative enhancement for spin down
3/16/2019 10:09 PM	Long Lab	f-mm = 11637.0 x 12 MHz
3/16/2019 10:09 PM	Elena Long	A whopping 1/2%. That was anticlimatic. :-(
3/16/2019 10:11 PM	Elena Long	Something seems off though, because I don't know why the mmwaves would have saturated so low power if something weird wasn't happening
3/16/2019 10:13 PM	Elena Long	Switching to Q-meter for spin up
3/16/2019 10:14 PM	Long Lab	Putting mmwaves back to f+mm = 11683.5 MHz, full power
3/16/2019 10:16 PM	Elena Long	Not seeing anything in the Q meter
3/16/2019 10:17 PM	Elena Long	wait, maybe I am
3/16/2019 10:17 PM	Elena Long	there it is
3/16/2019 10:18 PM	Elena Long	It's there but looks absolutely terrible

3/16/2019 10:59 PM	Elena Long	Looks about the same as before, sorry David for the VNA noise in those few runs
3/16/2019 11:00 PM	Long Lab	Beginning spin-down
3/16/2019 11:01 PM	Long Lab	Yep, it spun down
3/16/2019 11:02 PM	Long Lab	Beginning spin-up
3/16/2019 11:05 PM	Long Lab	And spin-down
3/16/2019 11:11 PM	Long Lab	Beginning spin-up
3/16/2019 11:14 PM	Long Lab	And final spin-down
3/16/2019 11:17 PM	Elena Long	Done

3/16/2019 11:22 PM	Elena Long	and taking some final TEs with the q-meter and VME
3/16/2019 11:25 PM	Elena Long	Final look at the TE. Good bye, troublesome butanol.

3/17/2019 12:03 AM	Elena Long	22 liters of LHe left in the 3rd dewar
3/17/2019 12:04 AM	Elena Long	Magnet is ramped down, ending VNA sweeps
3/17/2019 12:16 AM	Elena Long	Tomorrow you may luck out with one final partial fill, which might be enough to do NMR on Cup #4 if you wanted to try it. Magnet is filled, fridge is almost filled, and without the pumps running the helium goes quite a bit further.
3/17/2019 12:17 AM	Elena Long	I'm tapping out, though. I'll see y'all later next week at some point. :-)
3/17/2019 12:23 AM	Lab	<TRANSFER CLOSED>
3/17/2019 12:25 AM	Elena Long	Everything shut off, pop-off valves opened, dry gas line closed, magnet off, mmwaves off and USB unplugged. Magnet and fridge full, lines closed. Heater straps set to 15% and 45 C. I think that's it for me. Good night, Cool Down!!

3/17/2019 12:35 AM	Elena Long	And I know I mentioned this a million times already, but for the record before I leave: The butanol stick is still in and needs to be taken out by tomorrow afternoon before the fridge warms back up to 150K

3/17/2019 10:29 AM	Elena Long	When you take out the stick, could you please take a bunch of photos before removing the material?
3/17/2019 11:31 AM	Elena Long	<@U70SSTQFL> For future reference, the M.LM would be much easier to read on the strip chart if it was just points instead of a connected line. It goes wonky whenever we ramp, which is expected since we're putting voltage on the leads, and unconnected points would stop it from obscuring the other thermometer
3/17/2019 12:22 PM	David Ruth	<@U7166QLBW> will do, on both counts
3/17/2019 1:35 PM	David Ruth	Nathaly and I have pulled the target stick and inserted material from cup 2 into a bottle in Beta-4. Cup 4 was empty so we lost that material at some point earlier.

3/17/2019 1:49 PM	Elena Long	Auto cooldown analysis came out with a few bugs that need to be resolved but looks decent. Precool data didn't make it in because I made a separate file. Will work out some of the bugs so it will look better next time.  ---  attached=[03-17-2019_cooldown.png]

3/17/2019 2:02 PM	Elena Long	Thank you everyone!!!
3/17/2019 2:03 PM	Elena Long	Was getting the stick out easy again?
3/17/2019 2:05 PM	Nathaly Santiesteban	Yes, it was very easy.
