Currently a scaffolding has been constructed - but nothing really more than that. What comes next is as follows:
	slifercal:
		Short term:	
			- MULTI-THREADDING B-A-B-Y!
			- Decoupple "n-most stable" from graphing module
			- Decoupple comments from graphin module
			- Decoupple multiple-files for graphing from graphing module
		
		Long term:
			- Implement "general" features (one thermistor look up, etc..)
			- Implement GUI
		
	
	Thermistor Profile:
		thermistor_profile.update_calpoint()
			(DONE) Grab file names of graphs produced by data-ripper
			(DONE) Parse file names.
			(DONE) If parsed file name matches thermistor corresponding to thermistor profile instance - keep that parsed information.
			(DONE) Locate where in curve_coefficent_data.csv are points to be replaced
			(DONE) Execute based on that above information
			- ADD shell thermometry to curve_coefficent_data.csv
			- WRITE TO LOGFILE.
