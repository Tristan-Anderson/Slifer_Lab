4.27.2019 Thermistor profile:

Currently a scaffolding has been constructed - but nothing really more than that. What comes next is as follows:
	slifercal:
		Short term:	
			- MULTI-THREADDING B-A-B-Y!
			- Decoupple "n-most stable" from graphing module
			- Decoupple comments from graphin module
			- Decoupple multiple-files for graphing from graphing module
		
		Long term:
			- Implement "general" features (one thermistor look up, etc..)
			- Implement GUI
		
	
	Thermistor Profile:
		thermistor_profile.update_calpoint()
			(DONE) Grab file names of graphs produced by data-ripper
			(DONE) Parse file names.
			(DONE) If parsed file name matches thermistor corresponding to thermistor profile instance - keep that parsed information.
			(DONE) Locate where in curve_coefficent_data.csv are points to be replaced
			(DONE) Execute based on that above information
			- ADD shell thermometry to curve_coefficent_data.csv
			- WRITE TO LOGFILE.

	Slifer Cal:
		keyword_highlighter(keywords)
			- Pass function a list of keywords
			- Uses plotting module to plot the information surrounding those keywords.

	Tri-analyze:
		Needs significant work. See the laundry list present in LabBook.
		- Decouple n-best (Stable regions) from  graphing
		- Decouple commenting from graphing ... etc.	
		- REMOVE: Suite functionality. Add option for n-thermistors as opposed to analyzing the FULL datafile
		- ADD: Thermistor in n-th range plotting
		- ADD: Thermistor Date range plotting
		- ADD: Keyword lookup
	Graph:
		Identified interesting plotting region. CCS.F4_LHe_in_range_58106.png
			- Showing oscillations on the order of 100 Ohms at 3200 ohms. Oscillation magnitude on the order of 1/32 the measured ohmage.
		Additional oscilations identified in AB.F5_LHe_in_range_58180.png on the order of 
	
	Temperature Profile:
		Noticed that tp Auto-update-calibrations was not writing updated coefficents to the curve_coefficent_data.csv : Needs fixing.
